# Weather App

This is a simple JavaScript project that I, Vansh Singh, created to practice my JavaScript skills. The application provides current weather information and a forecast feature to give users insights into upcoming weather conditions.

## Description

The Weather App allows users to search for a city and retrieve the current weather data along with a 5-day forecast. This project is a great way for me to enhance my JavaScript abilities and understand how to work with APIs.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: Displays the current temperature and weather conditions for a specified city.
- **Forecast Weather**: Provides a 5-day weather forecast with hourly updates.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vansh0784/weather-app.git
